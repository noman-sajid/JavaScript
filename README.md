# JavaScript Interview Preparation 🚀

This repository contains my structured preparation for JavaScript interviews.
It focuses on fundamentals, problem-solving, and practical exercises, organized
for clarity and consistent daily practice.

## Repository Structure

### 📂 Concepts
Core JavaScript concepts with explanations and examples.
- Scope, closures, hoisting
- Async JavaScript
- Prototypes and classes
- ES6+ features

### 📂 Practice
Problem-solving exercises focused on logic and data structures.
- Strings
- Arrays
- Loops and conditionals
- Edge cases

### 📂 Exercises (Mini Projects)
Small hands-on projects to apply concepts in real scenarios.
- DOM manipulation
- Basic utilities
- Logic-based mini apps

### 📂 Quick Surge ⚡
Short, focused coding problems solved rapidly to build interview reflexes.
- One problem per file
- Clear problem statement + solution
- Emphasis on clean logic and fundamentals

This section is designed for speed, consistency, and daily GitHub activity.

## Goals
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving under time constraints
- Build confidence for technical interviews
- Maintain consistent daily practice

## Notes
All solutions are written in plain JavaScript without unnecessary abstractions.
Problems are intentionally kept simple and readable to reflect interview expectations.
