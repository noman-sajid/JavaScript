This is the "Golden File" for your VS Code notes. It’s structured to follow your philosophy: reducing cognitive load while maintaining technical depth.

🟡 Breadth-First Search (BFS) 🟡
1. Definition
Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbor nodes at the present "depth" or "level" prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses a Queue (FIFO) data structure to track which nodes to visit next.

2. The Analogy: The "Street Light" Crew
Imagine a city at night. You start at the City Center (Root).

You don't just run down one long highway until you hit the woods (DFS/Drill).

Instead, you light every street lamp exactly 1 block away from the center.

Only once every "1-block" light is glowing do you move out to the "2-block" lights.

The Queue is the line of electricians waiting. New streets found are sent to the back of the line.
